üßê Project philosophy
The Well app is a mental health and mindfulness app built on top of the science of positive psychology. The Well app is more than just another meditation or journaling app; it encourages you to enhance and reflect on your day with structured, guided activities.

There are 5 daily tasks that the Well app asks you to complete each day: record 3 gratitudes, write a journal entry, perform 3 acts of kindness, exercise for 20 minutes, and meditate for 15 minutes.

Read more about the Well app on the project homepage.

üë®‚Äçüíª Tech stack
Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack the Well app uses:

This project uses the Flutter app development framework. Flutter is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile, desktop, and the web.
For persistent storage (database), the app uses the Hive package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
To send local push notifications, the app uses the flutter_local_notifications package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
The app uses the font "Work Sans" as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
